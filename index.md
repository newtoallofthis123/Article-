## Hello, welcome to Article from Github
This is the website of the official repository of Articles- , I maintain this repository and I write articles in it everyday. The articles are in a pdf format for download and can be read on Github as well. Hope you enjoy them

##Ideology 
Most of the news and how to sites are hosted on their own servers. I thought why not make a Github pages instead of a how-to site. I also licensed my articles as common use and are open-source

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/Article-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
